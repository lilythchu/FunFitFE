    description: "I thought that you'd remember, but it seems that you forgot. It's hard for me to blame you when you were already lost. Oh yeah. I'm tired of always waiting. Oh, yeah, yeah. I see you changed your number, that's why you don't get my calls. I gave you all of me, now you don't wanna be involved. Oh, yeah, yeah. I really gotta face it. Oh, yeah, yeah. I just wanna be the one. But to you, we're already done. Tell me, why'd you have to hit and run me? Now I'm all alone, cryin' ugly. You broke my heart just for fun. Took my love and just left me numb. Now it's eight in the morning. Hate in the morning (All because of you)",

    description: "Why can't we just keep resisting our empty hopes? You're so different when we're all alone. Where is the person I used to know? Where did he go? The one I met, the one that I fell in love with. Now you're like a stranger, I don't know who you were or where we're going. I don't know where this is going, going. Everything's all wrong, it ain't like before. But the one that I once loved, where did he go, go? And who is this stranger knocking on my door? You're so two-faced. Tell me that you love me. But you'll always run to another.",
