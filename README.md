## What is Funfit? 
Funfit is a mobile application that helps users stick with their workout routines, thus promoting a healthy lifestyle. 

## Problem motivation 
As both of us are interested in exercising, it was not diffcult for us to come up with the idea of Funfit for Orbital 2022. As we have used fitness apps before, we are excited to enhance the efficiency of the app. Not only through the friendly and refreshing design, but we also plan to implement algorithms to improve user experience. One algorithm is the suggestion algorithm, which recommends workout routines to user based on their indicated interests. The other is similar to friend suggestion algorithm, which we are also thrilled to discover more about (partly because we got the opportunity to know in detailed how Facebook recommends our friends). 

With the fascinating journey of building the app, we expect to help students like us to maintain a healthy lifestyle that entails exercising and together build a supportive and inspiring community.

### Detailed functionalities 
1. Profile page:
- View user’s information: avatar, name, age, ultimate lifestyle target, workout interests.
- View rank of user + points (which is calculated based on workout routine completion, or in other words, how much the user sticks to the routine).

2. Calendar page:
- View all dates (Date on which user worked out will be marked).
- View each date, there shows exercises done in that particular date.

3. Routine page:
- View all routines, including recommended ones (filterd based on user's interests) and self-created ones.
- View each routine.
- Create a routine by setting the goal for the routine, filling in exercises' name and according timing. Every day the user does the routine, points will be added to the user’s rank. Once the final goal is reached, extra points will be added to the user’s profile. 
- Schedule the routine and set reminders.
- Save recommended routine to user's library.
- Play a routine: there will be a voice reading the name of each exercise out loud followed by the timer that has been assigned to the exercise (the timer will announce when half of the time has passed, count down when there is 3 seconds left)
+ The exercise name being read out loud will be tentatively implemented by a Text-to-Speech api such as ResponsiveVoice Text To Speech API)
+ The timing will be implemented as a countdown timer and audio will be played when certain amount of time has been reached (using libraries that could play audio such as audio-play)
- Delete routines.
- Edit routines (if created by yourself).
